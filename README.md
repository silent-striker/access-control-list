I have created two separate programs for standard and extended acls in their respective folders as per name.

I have created txt files for data, one being standard/extended_acl_input.txt for all the acl statements. Second, standard/extended_acl_ip_addresses.txt with all the ip addresses to test against.

The programs are written in python, so to run them you would need python 3 in the system. To run the program use the following,

```
    python3 ./standard_acl_processor.py
```

Similarly for extended, just replace the filename with "extended_acl_processor.py"
